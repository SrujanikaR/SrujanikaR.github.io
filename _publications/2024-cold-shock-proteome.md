Adaptation to hypothermia is important for skeletal muscle cells under
physiological stress and is used for therapeutic hypothermia (mild hypothermia
at 32 째C). We show that hypothermic preconditioning at 32 째C for 72 hours
improves the differentiation of skeletal muscle myoblasts using both C2C12 and
primary myoblasts isolated from 3 month and 18-month-old mice. We analyzed the
cold-shock proteome of myoblasts exposed to hypothermia (32 째C for 6 and 48 h)
and identified significant changes in pathways related to RNA processing and
central carbon, fatty acid, and redox metabolism. The analysis revealed that
levels of the cold-shock protein RBM3, an RNA-binding protein, increases with
both acute and chronic exposure to hypothermic stress, and is necessary for the
enhanced differentiation and maintenance of mitochondrial metabolism. We also
show that overexpression of RBM3 at 37 째C is sufficient to promote
mitochondrial metabolism, cellular proliferation, and differentiation of C2C12
and primary myoblasts. Proteomic analysis of C2C12 myoblasts overexpressing
RBM3 show significant enrichment of pathways involved in fatty acid metabolism,
RNA metabolism and the electron transport chain. Overall, we show that the
cold-shock protein RBM3 is a critical factor that can be used for controlling
the metabolic network of myoblasts.
