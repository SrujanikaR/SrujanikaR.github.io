Though mitochondria have their own genome and protein synthesis machineries,
the majority of the mitochondrial proteins are actually encoded by the nuclear
genome. Most of these mitochondrial proteins are imported into specific
compartments of the mitochondria due to their mitochondrial target sequence
(MTS). Unlike the nuclear target sequence, the MTS of most of the mitochondrial
localized proteins remain poorly understood, mainly due to their variability,
heterogeneity, unconventional modes of action, mitochondrial
potential-dependent transport, and other complexities. Recently, we reported
that transient receptor potential vanilloid subtype 4 (TRPV4), a
thermosensitive cation channel, is physically located at the mitochondria. Here
we char- acterize a small segment (AA 592- 630) located at the TM4-loop4-TM5
segment of TRPV4 that acts as a novel MTS. The same re- gion remains highly
conserved in all vertebrates and contains a large number of point mutations
each of which causes an diverse spectrum of diseases in human. Using confocal
and super-resolution microscopy, we show that this MTS of TRPV4 or its mutants
localizes to the mitochondria independently and also induces functional and
quantitative changes in the mitochondria. By using conformal microscopy, we
could detect the presence of the MTS region within the isolated mitochondria.
These findings may be important to understand the complexity of MTS and
TRPV4-induced channelopathies better.
