I am an incoming graduate student at the Graduate School of Biomedical
Sciences, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX, USA.

Previously, I was a research fellow at the Institute of Stem Cells and
Regenerative Medicine (inStem), Bengaluru, India where I work with [Dr. Aravind
Ramanathan](https://instem.res.in/faculty/arvind). Prior to that, I did my
masters from National Institute of Science Education and Research (NISER),
Bhubaneswar, India where I worked in [Dr. Chandan Goswami's
Lab](https://www.niser.ac.in/~chandan) and my thesis was titled,
_Characterization of the Brachyolmia causing mutant TRPV4 channels in various
cellular functions_.
